I built this project developing a deep learning neural network model. The built model is in the form of a handwritten-digit recognition algorithm. 

Using the MNIST [Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology] dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9, the model boasts of an accuracy score to the tone of 98%.
